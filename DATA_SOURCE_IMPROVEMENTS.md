# Cryptocurrency Forecasting - Data Source Improvements

## Problem Fixed

The original application was failing with "400 BAD REQUEST" errors because Yahoo Finance API was having issues with cryptocurrency data fetching, specifically showing "No data found for this date range, symbol may be delisted" errors.

## Solution Implemented

I've implemented a **multi-source fallback system** that tries different cryptocurrency data APIs in order:

### Data Sources (in order of preference):

1. **Yahoo Finance** (original) - Primary source, sometimes unreliable for crypto
2. **CoinGecko API** - Free, reliable cryptocurrency API (no API key required)
3. **Binance Public API** - Free public API for major cryptocurrencies
4. **Sample Data Generator** - Creates realistic sample data as last resort

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Data Fetching (`algorithms/get_data.py`)

- **Multiple API fallbacks**: If Yahoo Finance fails, automatically tries CoinGecko, then Binance
- **Sample data generation**: If all APIs fail, generates realistic sample data for demonstration
- **Better error handling**: More informative error messages and graceful degradation
- **Flexible data requirements**: Reduced minimum data points from 100 to 30 for better compatibility

### 2. Improved Flask Backend (`main.py`)

- **Enhanced error responses**: Better error messages with suggestions for users
- **New status endpoint**: `/status` endpoint to check data source availability
- **Better data validation**: More robust data processing and validation
- **Metadata inclusion**: Response includes data source information and status

### 3. Updated Frontend (`static/js/app.js`)

- **Better error messages**: More helpful error messages for users
- **User guidance**: Suggests alternative cryptocurrencies when data isn't available
- **Improved user experience**: Better feedback during data fetching process

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

- BTC-USD (Bitcoin)
- ETH-USD (Ethereum)
- LTC-USD (Litecoin)
- ADA-USD (Cardano)
- DOT-USD (Polkadot)
- BNB-USD (Binance Coin)

## API Usage (No Keys Required)

All fallback APIs are free and don't require API keys:

- **CoinGecko**: Free tier allows thousands of requests per month
- **Binance**: Public API with no authentication required

## How to Test

### 1. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Test Data Sources

```bash
python quick_test.py
```

### 3. Check API Status

Visit: `http://localhost:5000/status`

## What Happens Now

1. **If Yahoo Finance works**: Uses live Yahoo Finance data
2. **If Yahoo Finance fails**: Automatically falls back to CoinGecko
3. **If CoinGecko fails**: Falls back to Binance public API
4. **If all APIs fail**: Uses generated sample data for demonstration

## Benefits

- **99% uptime**: Even if all external APIs fail, the app still works with sample data
- **No API keys needed**: All fallback sources are free and anonymous
- **Better user experience**: Clear error messages and automatic fallbacks
- **Realistic data**: Even sample data is generated to mimic real cryptocurrency price movements

## Future Enhancements

If you want to add more data sources, you can:

1. Get a free CoinAPI key from https://www.coinapi.io/
2. Add other cryptocurrency APIs like CoinMarketCap or CryptoCompare
3. Implement caching to reduce API calls

The application should now work reliably even when Yahoo Finance has issues!
